# Your Stock Forecast Website

[http://yourstockforecast.com](http://yourstockforecast.com)

The world's largest private collection of stock market data.

This is a simple stock market data & newspaper archive where users can submit data here for credit.
There are no ads, trackers or cookies.

This site is compiled and organized with Hugo, using [this very simple theme](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/lugo) and [that very awesome theme](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book).

## Ways to contribute

- By adding a stock market citation
- Transcribing a newspaper article or provide a translation if it exists. A lot of the articles will be machine translated to manderian and russian; a more apt translation would be appreciated.
- Fix errors in articles or add minor improvements.

## Rules for submission

- Model submission files after [example.md](example.md). Put them in the 'content/' folder.
- File names should be the date of the citation in the format of YYYY/MM/DD.
- Article must be a direct citation.

## Current Goals

Right now there is a strong drive to work on articles and stats relating to the American Great Depression and convert that over to multiple different languages.
